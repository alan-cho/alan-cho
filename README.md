### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alan!

I'm a software engineer with experience in building full-stack applications. Recently I built [Pinniped](https://github.com/pinniped-baas), a backend-as-a-service catered for small Node.js teams, to aid in software development. Pinniped includes automated pipelines for deployment, auto-generated RESTful APIs based on the database, a dashboard for managing the backend, and more.
